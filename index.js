A ternary operator takes three operands: 
1 - a condition followed by a question mark (?), 2- then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), 
3- and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

** Ternary operator must always return a value
